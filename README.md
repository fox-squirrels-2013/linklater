this app was designed to save some links.

it uses [firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).  that's cool.

it also is setup to be deployed to heroku as a client-side-only app
using some strange bootstrapping w [php from here](http://www.lemiffe.com/how-to-deploy-a-static-page-to-heroku-the-easy-way/)

still wip.

thanks Brent!  that was fun.
